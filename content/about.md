# About Us

We are a club in University of Toronto that aims on bringing together people who are passionate about or simply curious about cybersecurity, and work together as a group to broaden our knowledge about the subject. 
We will participate in `Capture the Flag` competitions held through the year to apply the knowledge we gain along the way.
